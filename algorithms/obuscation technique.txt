3)Pseudonymization: Replaces sensitive data with artificial identifiers or pseudonyms, allowing data to be linked to the same individual without revealing their identity.

4)Address Obfuscation: Techniques like Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) rearrange the memory address space to make it difficult for attackers to predict the location of specific processes or data, enhancing security.

5)Objective-C Message Call and Metadata Obfuscation: Involves modifying or hiding metadata and symbols in Objective-C applications to protect against reverse engineering and unauthorized access to the codebase.
