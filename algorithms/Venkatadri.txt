1. Code minification:-
#remove all unnecessary spaces, newlines, and comments.

2. Name obfuscation:-
#Rename variables, functions, and classes to meaningless names.

3. String encoding:-
#Encode strings to make them unreadable.

4. Control Flow obfuscation:-
#Make flow control harder to follow.

5. Macros and preprocessor Directives:-
#Use macros to obscure code logic.

6. Function pointers:-
#use function pointers to hide execution flow

7. Code Flattening:-
# Replace loops and ifs with a state machine 


8. Self-Modifying code:-
# generate and execute code at runtime

9. Junk code injection:-
# add dead code that never executes

10. Use packers:
# usepacers like UPX

11. Use templates to hide code:-
# templates create complex code at compile time
#also use function overloading with templates

12. Fake code paths:-
# add misleading conditions that never executes

13. overloading:-
#function and operator overloading to hide the real operation.

14. bytecode :
# convert logic to bytecode and interpret it dynamically
